This is a toy reinforcement learning project. 
The goal is to automate the breaking process of a train, without any prior knowledge of how a train should break in order to reach a particular point in space (on a linear axis)

# Training

You can train your model using
    python train.py train path_to_model
    
Once your model is trained, you may use it by calling
    python train.py run path_to_model
